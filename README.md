# VIGENERE CYPHER

This program is an implementation of Vigenere Cypher, with a few tweaks: <br>

<ol>
    <li>It generates a list of 80 keywords, created from random uppercase letters of the alphabet</li>
    <li>It selects a random keyword from the generated list of keyword</li>
    <li>It uses the selected keyword to create a key that is equal in length to the plain text to be encrypted </li>
    <li>It uses the generated key to encrypt uppercase plain text </li>
    <li>It then decrypts the cipher text using the key </li>
</ol>
    NB: Lowercase letters, spaces and special characters are not implemented. Left for future work if life becomes boring
